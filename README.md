Have you ever felt like Attack Speed wasn't good enough? Then this mod is for you!

This mod completely disabled the passive recharging of skills, and instead turns cooldowns into a system of rotations.
#### Currently only works on Huntress.

## Features

* Whenever you hit with your Main Skill, your Secondary Skill should be cooled down by [Default: 1] seconds

* Whenever you hit with your Secondary Skill, your Special Skill should be cooled down by [Default: 2.5] seconds

## Configuration

* `COH_Primary bool` | Sets or gets the current Primary Skill Configuration

* `COH_Secondary bool float` | Sets or gets the current Secondary Skill Configuration

## Compatibility / Known issues

* Have not tested for compatibility with any mod. If you find any incompatabilities, please tell me (@Modernkennnern on the Risk of Rain 2 Modding Discord)

* In Multiplayer, non-hosts stops working after going to the second stage.

## Features I might add (In order of importance)
